# Hands-on Lab at DataStax Graph Workshop

This repo contains a _KillrVideoGraph_ data set and DataStax Studio notebooks that were used for the hands-on session of DataStax Graph Workshop in New York, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, etc. You are welcome to transfer these artifacts into your own environment to continue working with the hands-on examples and problems.

## Data
